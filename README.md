A Simple Web Server in Python Using Socket and Thread Programming

This is a simple two-file program that consists of  a network server program and the client program to demonstrate the use of implementation of socket and threads programming for web server usage.

Installation:
Clone or download the zip folder of repo and unzip.
Open a command-line instance in the main directory and run server.py.
Open the client.py file and modify the value of SERVER to the ip address that the server is running (should be shown in the terminal after running server.py successfully).
Save the client.py file and run it on a different terminal instance.
If the connection is successful there should  be a ‘msg received’ message in the terminal that runs the client file.
Press the Enter key to send subsequent messages on the client file terminal until DISCONNECT_MESSAGE which terminates the server handling of the client.

Issues:
Make sure firewalls and antiviruses are configured to allow incoming connections
If program doesn't work try different port numbers other than 5050
If still problematic try using different terminals (e.g. not from an IDE)
